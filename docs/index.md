# PDF Viewer

An out-of-the-box PDF viewer builds on PDF.js.

## Quick Start

You can use the starter to initialize a demo app to explore how to use this package in your own project.

```bash
# initialize a demo project with a quick starter
npm create @document-kits/viewer@latest my-app

cd my-app

npm install
npm run dev
```
